## CS480 Final Project
### Idea - Image to Music
For this project, we will use the Python Libraries PyAudio and OpenCV, to perform an image analysis on a user-decided image, and from the image generate a song.  Some ideas that we have for ways to compile this song from an image are to create notes which correspond to different colors, then generate a song from that.  Another idea is to take R/G/B and interperate it as Pitch/Duration/Amplitude.
There are many possibile ways to implement this idea, and we won't know what works and doesn't work until we try it, so that's the main plan :)
